        <h1>OPTIONS</h1>

        <div>Here are some of the hobbies that occupy my time, though admittedly I'm better at accumulating more hobbies than I am at updating this page.</div>

        <div>
            <details open>
                <summary>--books</summary>

                <div>I read endlessly, mostly fantasy and speculative fiction with some sci-fi, philosophy, and manga thrown in. Goodreads is the more or less authoritative source for what's on my shelf.</div>
                <div>My current book recommendation is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth-Book-ebook/dp/B00H25FCSQ/">The Fifth Season</a> by N.K. Jemison.</div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--chado</summary>

                <div>I've studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony">chadō</a>, which is traditional Japanese tea ceremony, since early 2017, and earned my first certification from the Urasenke school in early 2018.</div>
                <div><img src="./imgs/usucha.jpg"></div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--crafts</summary>

                <div>I dabble in a wide variety of crafty things: crochet, chainmaille jewelry, needle felting, torchworking, forging, nail art, and more.</div>
                <div><img src="./imgs/afghan.jpg"></div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--food-and-drink</summary>

                <div>I enjoy cooking and fine dining, though nowadays I don't photograph much of what I make or eat. My favorite consumables include all sorts of Japanese food, molecular gastronomy, bourbon, Malbec wine, anything raw, and anything weird.</div>
                <div><img src="./imgs/bento.jpg"></div>
            </details>

            <details open>
                <summary>--games</summary>

                <div>I love all sorts of games: board games, tabletop RPGs, video games, etc. I have a large Nintendo collection and generally enjoy retro games just as much as modern ones.</div>
            </details>

            <details open>
                <summary>--music</summary>

                <div>I've played the clarinet (Bb and bass) since 1998, flute since 2002, and piano for longer than both. In 2010 I picked up the acoustic guitar as well, but freely admit that I lack any semblance of natural talent for it.</div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--pets</summary>

                <div>I care strongly about animal welfare and advocate for informed, high standard at-home pet care, especially for "exotic" animals.</div>
                <div>I've volunteered in various no-kill cat and animal shelters on and off since 2003. I rode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_pleasure">Western Pleasure</a> horses for about 5 years when I was younger, during which time I also volunteered at the stable and led trail rides.</div>

            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--succulents</summary>

                <div>I've kept a wide variety of succulents over the years, and have a soft spot for the <i>Aizoaceae</i> family in particular.</div>
